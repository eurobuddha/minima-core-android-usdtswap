/**
 * Restart the market keeper the moment the device (or, in Secure Folder, the folder's user) comes up
 * after a reboot — and after an APK update. Before this receiver, post-reboot recovery rode only the
 * 15-min WorkManager job, and the 2026-07-07 outage showed the full failure chain: reboot → Secure
 * Folder locked → hours later WorkManager relaunched a service that then sat inert because the node app
 * wasn't running (the pairing self-heal in SwapService fixes that half).
 *
 * Starting a specialUse FGS from BOOT_COMPLETED is legal — Android 15's boot-time FGS restriction list
 * covers dataSync, camera, media playback/projection, microphone and phoneCall, not specialUse (which
 * SwapService uses on API 34+).
