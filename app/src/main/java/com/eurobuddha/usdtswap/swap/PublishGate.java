/**
 * Cross-host publish coordination. The Activity and the Service share one process (same convention as
 * {@code MainActivity.FOREGROUND}), so statics are the correct scope — and deliberately in-memory: no
 * publish survives a dead process, so neither should the guard.
 *
 * IN-FLIGHT GUARD — one publish per slot (order book / OTC board) at a time, with a timeout so a lost
 * node callback can never wedge the keep-alive.
 *
 * SUPERSEDE GENERATION — user actions (manual publish, edit, withdraw) and the peg-tombstone safety path
 * bump {@link #bumpGen()}. An AUTO publish captures {@link #gen()} before sending; if the generation has
 * moved by the time its onSent fires, the result is stale and must be dropped (no ok-stamp, no
 * {@code engine.setMyOrder}) — a stale auto result can never overwrite fresher user or safety intent.
